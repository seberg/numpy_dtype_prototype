This is just my own prototyping/thoughts for numpy dtypes, as of now
(unlikely that i keep this updated), supports very basic casting,
dtype discovery and ufunc dispatching.

Some unit support is started on, there are still a lot of open
questions and this is likely simply not quite the right approach.
Some of the things could be solved also with a registration
approach, since it means we only need to try one function (direction),
but this may be a bit simpler?
